Research and find out the reason for the acronyms ; HTML and CSS used to describe the 2 major technologies for web development

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are essential technologies in web development and are used to create the structure and design of a website, respectively.

The role of HTML is to provide the content and structure of a website. HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and images, are used to define the content of a website and how it should be displayed.

CSS, on the other hand, is used to specify the visual style of a website, including colors, fonts, layout, and more. CSS styles are applied to HTML elements, allowing web developers to create consistent and attractive designs that are separate from the content.

HTML and CSS is used whenever you are creating a website. They provide the foundation for a well-structured and visually appealing website.

In general, HTML and CSS is used whenever you want to create a static website, or a website that does not require complex dynamic interactions. They are also a good choice for small to medium-sized websites or projects, as they are simple to learn and use, and are widely supported across many different browsers and platforms.
